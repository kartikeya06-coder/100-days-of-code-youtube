We can you else statement with for loop
This is also very frequently asked ques in job interviews.
Basically it goes in the else statement only if the loop does not executes.
Else will always after for loop terminates.
Last iteration process hone ke baad hi else execute hoga . Agar beech mein break statement aa gaya to execute nahi hoga .
